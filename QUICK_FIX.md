# ✅ FIXED! Backend Now Works

## What Was Wrong?
The `npm run dev` command was only starting the frontend (Vite), not the backend server.

## What I Fixed
✅ Updated `package.json` to run both frontend AND backend together
✅ Added `concurrently` package to run both simultaneously  
✅ Backend now starts on port 3000, frontend on port 5173
✅ Vite proxy forwards `/api` requests to backend

## 🚀 How to Run (Simple!)

### Option 1: Run Everything Together (Recommended)
```powershell
cd "D:\projects\Meow share\meow-share-v2"
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- **Backend** on http://localhost:3000
- **Frontend** on http://localhost:5173

Then open: http://localhost:5173

### Option 2: Run Separately (Manual)
```powershell
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd "D:\projects\Meow share\meow-share-v2"
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd "D:\projects\Meow share\meow-share-v2"
npm run dev:frontend
```

## ✅ Test That It Works

### 1. Backend Health Check
Open: http://localhost:3000/api/health

Should see: `{"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}`

### 2. Frontend
Open: http://localhost:5173

Should see the Meow Share app with purple gradient!

### 3. Create Session
1. Click **"Create Session"** button
2. You should see a 6-character hex code (like `ABC123`)
3. ✅ If you see this, backend is working!

## 🎯 Available Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `npm run dev` | Start frontend + backend together |
| `npm run dev:frontend` | Start only frontend (port 5173) |
| `npm run dev:backend` | Start only backend (port 3000) |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build |

## 🔧 How It Works Now

```
Frontend (http://localhost:5173)
    ↓
    /api/* requests
    ↓
Vite Proxy (automatic)
    ↓
Backend (http://localhost:3000/api)
```

When you click "Create Session":
1. Frontend sends: `POST http://localhost:5173/api/sessions`
2. Vite proxy forwards to: `http://localhost:3000/api/sessions`
3. Backend creates session and returns code
4. Frontend displays the code ✅

## 🌐 For Vercel Deployment

Don't worry! Vercel deployment still works exactly the same:
- Frontend builds to `/dist`
- Backend runs as serverless function
- No changes needed for deployment!

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Backend Not Starting?
```powershell
# Check if port 3000 is in use
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Kill process if needed
Stop-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000).OwningProcess -Force
```

### Frontend Not Loading?
```powershell
# Check if port 5173 is in use
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 5173 -State Listen -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Session Creation Still Not Working?
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Check for errors
4. Check Network tab to see if API calls are being made

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ Backend works (tested with health check)
- ✅ Session creation works (tested with API call)
- ✅ Frontend ready
- ✅ Both can run together
- ✅ Ready for local development
- ✅ Ready for Vercel deployment

## 🎉 You're All Set!

Just run `npm run dev` and start using the app!
